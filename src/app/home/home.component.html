<h2>Welcome to my Art Portfolio</h2>

<div>This is a site that I created using Angular to show what I cam currently capable of doing in Angular and to have a place to publicly store my Art Portfolio. </div>
<div>As I am still learning how to draw, Early works will most likely implement higher quality traits compared to older works. </div>
